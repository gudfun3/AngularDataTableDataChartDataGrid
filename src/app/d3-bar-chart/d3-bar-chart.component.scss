/*
Style scope
The styles specified in @Component metadata apply only within the template of that component.

Special selectors
Component styles have a few special selectors from the world of shadow DOM style scoping
The :host selector is the only way to target the host element. You can't reach the host
 element from inside the component with other selectors because it's not part of the
  component's own template. The host element is in a parent component's template.
    :host {
  display: block;
  border: 1px solid black;
}

  then some of the combinators that are about to be deprecated
  (deprecated) /deep/, >>>, and ::ng-deep

Only encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.Native  won't work so you must use the :host /deep/  or  ::ng-deep combinators
* shadow piercing is done here using the only angular supported ::ng-deep combinator
*  or we can use like this 
:host /deep/ svg text {
    fill: yellow;
    font: 12px sans-serif;
    text-anchor: end;
  }
